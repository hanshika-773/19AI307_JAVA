# Ex.No:4(E)  Character Input Using do-while
## AIM:
To read and display multiple lines of character input using a do-while loop in Java.
## ALGORITHM :

1. Initialize `Scanner` and prompt the user to enter the number of characters (lines) to input.
2. Declare a `String` array of size `a + 1` to store the input lines.
3. Use a `do-while` loop to read lines from the user using `nextLine()` and store them in the array.
4. Print each input line immediately after reading it.
5. Continue the loop until `i <= a` to collect all the required inputs including handling the initial newline after `nextInt()`.

> **Note:** The extra line (`a + 1`) is needed because `nextInt()` does not consume the newline character, so the first `nextLine()` reads an empty string.
