# Ex.No:5(B) TIGHTLY ENCAPSULATED CLASS

## AIM:
To Create a java program to display the value of volume of cylinder get the radius and height value as input and use tightly encapsulated class.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Define `Cylinder` class:
-	a) Private variables `radius` and `height`
-	b) `setRadius(int r)` and `setHeight(int h)` methods to set values
-	c) `getVolume()` method:
- i) Calculate and print `volume = pi * radius * radius * height`
3.	In `Main` class `main` method:
-	a) Use `Scanner` to read `radius` and `height`
-	b) Create `Cylinder` object, set values, and call `getVolume()`
4.	End
