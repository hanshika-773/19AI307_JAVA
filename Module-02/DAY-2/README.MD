# Ex.No:2(B) ACCESS MODIFIERS

## AIM:
To print all numbers divisible by 7 from 100 to 1 in descending order.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the program and define the main method.

2. Use a for loop starting from 100 down to 1.

3. For each number i, check if it is divisible by 7 (i % 7 == 0).

4. If the condition is true, print the number followed by a comma.

5. Continue the loop until i reaches 1, then end the program.
## PROGRAM:
 ```

import java.util.*;
public class Demo{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        for(int i =100 ;i>=1;i--){
            if(i%7==0){
            System.out.print(i+", ");
            }
        }
    }
}

```

## OUTPUT:



## RESULT:
Thus the java program to display the addition number using private modifiers only was executed successfully.
